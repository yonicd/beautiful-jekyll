This is a list of R packages that have been published on CRAN and/or are still being developed on Github. Many of the projects are part of [open tools](https://www.metrumrg.com/try-open-source-tools/) developed in Metrum Research Group. You will see an icon <img src='img/mrgicon.png' height='15', width='15'> where this is relevant.
